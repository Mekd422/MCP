# Agent Rules – v2 (Planning-Heavy Variant)

## Purpose
This version was inspired by Boris Cherny’s guidance on treating rules as a contract.
The focus here was to force deliberate thinking before action.

## Rules

- Always restate the task in your own words before acting.
- Propose a clear step-by-step plan for completing the task.
- Explicitly list assumptions and uncertainties.
- Wait for user confirmation before executing destructive or irreversible actions.
- Break complex tasks into small, incremental steps.

## Observed Behavior

- Task alignment improved significantly.
- Fewer misunderstandings about intent.
- The agent became more predictable and methodical.

## Trade-offs

- Responses were slightly longer.
- For trivial tasks, the planning overhead sometimes felt unnecessary.

## Takeaway

Mandatory planning dramatically improved correctness and alignment. However, additional refinement was needed to balance speed and rigor.
