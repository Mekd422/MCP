# Agent Rules – v1 (Initial Collaboration Rules)

## Purpose
This version represents my first attempt at defining how the AI agent should collaborate with me beyond the mandatory Tenx MCP trigger rules.

The goal was to establish a baseline of expected behavior without over-constraining the agent.

## Rules

- Follow user instructions precisely and do not assume intent.
- Ask clarifying questions when the request is ambiguous.
- Prefer clarity over verbosity.
- Avoid modifying existing code unless explicitly requested.
- Provide explanations alongside solutions.

## Observed Behavior

- The agent was flexible and responsive.
- However, it occasionally skipped planning steps.
- Some responses jumped directly to solutions without validating assumptions.

## Takeaway

This version worked for simple tasks but lacked sufficient structure for complex or multi-step work. This motivated further experimentation with stricter planning requirements.
